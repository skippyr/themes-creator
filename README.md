# Themes Creator

## About

A collection of scripts to easily create and debug ports of themes, specially
for terminal emulators. By the way, these are also the tools that helps me
maintain my theme: [Flamerial](https://github.com/skippyr/flamerial).

## Usage

- The first thing to do is to create a file to store your theme's metadata.
  The lines of that file needs to follow this structure:

  | Line Number | Description |
  | - | - |
  | 1 | The name of the theme. |
  | 2 | The author of the theme. |
  | 3 | The license the theme is under. |
  | 4 | The URL of the upstream where the theme will be distributed. |
  | 5 | The color correspondent to ANSI 0 (black) (background)
  | 6 | The color correspondent to ANSI 1 (red)
  | 7 | The color correspondent to ANSI 2 (green)
  | 8 | The color correspondent to ANSI 3 (yellow)
  | 9 | The color correspondent to ANSI 4 (blue)
  | 10 | The color correspondent to ANSI 5 (magenta)
  | 11 | The color correspondent to ANSI 6 (cyan)
  | 12 | The color correspondent to ANSI 7 (white) (foreground)

  ANSI colors are the reference for developers to produce terminal emulators'
  themes.

  All the colors you use must be in HEX format, containing a `#` as the first
  character and they should not set opacity levels. You can use either upper or
  lower case characters.

  Apart from the background and foreground colors, you do not need to strictly
  respect the reference: for example, you can use a yellow color as ANSI 4
  (blue) without having an issue. This opens room for you to explore basically
  whatever combination you want.

  To help you create this file, there is the `template.theme` that you can
  use either as a template or to test the scripts: it contains a generic
  high-contrast dark theme.

- After you have created your metadata file, take a look in the contents of the
  `scripts/ports` directory. There you will find all the available scripts
  that can create ports of your theme.

  To create a port, run the desired script and use the path to your metadata
  file as an argument. For example, to create a Kitty theme using the template
  file:

  ```bash
  ruby scripts/ports/kitty.conf template.theme
  ```

  Like this, the theme file will be printed to `stdout`, but you can add one
  more argument to your commands: the path of a file where the theme should
  be stored instead. Theme files that are meant to be scripts, will
  be turned into executables automatically once created.

- After you have created your ports, if you need, you can use the
  `scripts/test/preview.rb` script to have a preview of your current terminal
  emulator's theme.

- Now, you are ready to start distributing ports of your theme.
